This project is meant as a learning project to dive deeper into deep learning and neural nets. With tensorflow and keras one can build powerful model very fast but doesn't necessarily learn about the algorithms behind the API. This project is meant to implement a very (very :smile:) simple neural net.

### Prerequisites

The micro project only requires numpy.

### Installing

Since there is only numpy required it might be overkill, but I would anyway just recommend to intall [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) right away. You can find the installation instruction for the given operating system in the link above.


### Demo
Will follow soon.
